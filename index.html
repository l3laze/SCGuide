  <br/>

  <h3>Superstars</h3>

  <br/>

  Superstars are the most important. They have stats for Power, Toughness, Speed, Charisma (POW, TGH, SPD, CHA) and an Alignment arrow. They also have an Ability named after their signature move, which increases 2 of their stats if it triggers.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Superstars start at level 0 and can reach a maximum of level 100. Each level will increase their stats and the affect of their Ability slightly. Superstars also have the special stat called matches played, which is how many times they have fought in the ring. Matches played increases their stats and Ability effect too, but much less than levels.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Next, modern Superstars have Techniques; these are another special ability that can trigger. Techniques can be upgraded by playing up to 100 matches with a card. They are active in all modes except Giants Unleashed and Team Roadblock.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  The following are in the form Technique Name (icon description) - Technique effect. <em>Explanation, if necessary</em>

  <br/>
  <br/>

  <ul>
    <li>Overrun (running person) - After Win: % chance to apply % of over-damage to next match.
    </li>
    <li>Assist (hand) - Before Match: % chance to gain % of stats of a random card in deck.
    </li>
    <li>Chain (chain link) - After Win: % chance to apply this cards Ability bonus to next match.
    </li>
    <li>Reversal (circular arrows) - After Loss: % chance to replay match with diferent stat matchup. <em>Can only trigger on the original match</em>
    </li>
    <li>Inspire (buff person flexing) - After Match: % chance to increase stats by % next match.
    </li>
    <li>Defend (shield) - After Match: % chance to reduce damage taken by % next match. <em>Buffs using target cards stats</em>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <br/>

  Superstars also have a Style, which is how they perform in the ring. Style determines which Techniques a Superstar can have. The following are in the form Style Name (icon description) - Techniques available

  <br/>
  <br/>

  <ul>
    <li>Grappler (grappling hook) - Assist, Chain, Inspire, Reversal</li>
    <li>Brawler (brass knuckles) - Chain, Defend, Overrun, Reversal</li>
    <li>Striker (moving fist) - Assist, Chain, Defend, Overrun</li>
    <li>Highflyer (airplane) - Assist, Inspire, Overrun, Reversal</li>
    <li>Orator (microphone) - Assist, Defend, Inspire, Reversal</li>
  </ul>

  <br/>
  <br/>

  If a Superstar currently has a Championship, or title, in real life it will be displayed as an icon on their card(s). Each Championship gives a % chance and stat boost to the Superstars ability. Champs are updated within 72 hours after a title changes hands.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  <div class="line"></div>

  <h3>Equipment</h3>
  
  <br/>

  Equipment cards can be attached to Superstars to make them more powerful with a variety of boosts: stats, Ability trigger %, and Ability effect. Special Credits-only Equipment can be used to force cards to be of a specific Alignment (e.g. Equip it to a Superstar to make it an Up).

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Equipment cards gain a second boost at 50 matches played with them equipped, and a third boost at 100. The first boost is always the same, but the second and third seem to be random.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  <div class="line"></div>

  <h3>Supports</h3>

  <br/>

  There are 2 types of Support cards - Manager and Action. If Supports are used in a mode the deck will have 1 Manager and 2 Actions.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  The Manager is activated at the beginning of a game before the first match. They increase at least 1 stat on ALL cards in a deck, and can increase up to 2 stats.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Actions can each be used once by a player to attempt to gain an advantage in a single matchup. Actions can effect 1-2 stats, except for Second Wind which effects all 4.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Manager cards only increase stats of a players cards. Action cards though can either increase the stats of a players cards or decrease the stats of the enemy cards.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Supports start at level 0 and can reach a maximum of level 100. Each level will increase their effect slightly.
  
  <br/>

<div class="line"></div>

<h3>Pro Superstar and Support</h3>

  <br/>

  2 base Superstar or Support cards can be combined into a Pro card. For max stats they both need to be level 100, and Superstars must have 100 matches played. When not done properly the pro will get a silver star, but when done properly the pro will get a gold star showing they have the maximum potential.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  The resulting pro after combining will be reset to level 0, but will have a new max level of 105. Superstars also have their matches played reset to 0/100. Again, levels and matches played increase stats and Ability effect, but less than as a base.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Pro cards are stronger than bases from their tier, and have similar stats to bases from the tier above them once they have been leveled up (and had matches played again on Superstars).

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Fortifying is only possible on Pro cards by using a base or Pro of the same card, and unlocks up to 3 extra levels (often referred to as F1/F2/F3). A base unlocks 1 level, whereas a Pro unlocks 2 levels. Using a card that is at max level to Fortify will both unlock Fortification level(s) and level up to activate the boost. A pro at F3 will be stronger than a similar base from a tier higher.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  When a Superstar is combined into a Pro or Fortified, if both cards don't have the same Technique, it will ask which 1 to keep in a popup dialog.

  <br/>

<div class="line"></div>

<h3>Rarity Tiers, Special Cards</h3>

  <br/>

  Cards come in different rarities called tiers, and higher tiers are stronger than lower ones by a small % (max 15%?). This means there's always a massive difference between the lowest and highest tier. The good thing about this is that pros at tier N are about equal to singles at tier N + 1, which helps create a natural progression cycle.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  There are also a variery of special cards that are extra-powerful within each tier, each with different methods to acquiring them. They are Event (Regular/Half-Heroic/Heroic and Ranked), Special Edition (including Paid Live Event-based), and Fusion.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Non-heroic, Fusion, and low-ranked Event cards have just slightly-higher stats than default cards. Half-heroic and SE have stats a bit higher than those. Finally, Heroic and high-ranked Event cards have stats similar to default cards from the tier above theirs.

  <br/>
  <br/>

</div>

<div class="line"></div>

<a name="singlePlayer" href="#singlePlayer" onclick="collapsible(this);scrollIntoView(this);return false" class="collapsible">Single Player</a>

<div id="singlePlayer">
  <br/>
  <br/>

  Each mode consists of 1 or more matches. A match can be Solo or Tag with male or female Superstars. The winner of each match is determined by the greater total of up to 3 stats.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Energy is shared among all PvP modes (War, Royal Rumble, Elimination Chamber). Playing in any PvP mode generates PvP League points, win or lose.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  <ul>
    <li>Max Energy: 5</li>
    <li>Energy Regen: 15mins</li>
    </ul>
    
    <hr/>

    <h3>Wild/War</h3>

    <br/>

    <ul>
    <li>Opponent: AI (Mixed?)</li>
    <li>Enemy: Mirror</li>
    <li>Matches: 3; Tiebreaker if necessary.</li>
    <li>Deck: Custom - 4x male and 2x female Superstars, 1x Manager and 2x Action Support</li>
  </ul>

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Each round will be either a Solo or Tag match. Fast and easy, but with minimal rewards compared to what just one energy can get.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  The strongest deck uses 4x balanced male and 2x balanced female pro Superstars (of the highest tier) setup as tag teams - e.g. left, right, left, right. It can still lose to more powerful enemies, but it is less common than with other decks.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  The best deck to go undefeated (for the weekly Wild Wednesday Quest) replaces the last of the males with a low-power Superstar. As the last card it also means it is still possible to idle a game because it won't get picked unless needed. A single low-tier female can be used instead of a male or in addition to it, but loses a little more often.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  If your deck is not using the current highest tier the game can generate a deck tier mirror with 3 or more highest-tier cards and 2 lowest-tier cards. This is rare, which is good because it is impossible to win against them.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  <div class="line"></div>

  <h3>Royal Rumble</h3>

  <br/>

  <ul>
    <li>Opponent: AI (Mixed?)</li>
    <li>Enemy: Mirror</li>
    <li>Matches: 15</li>
    <li>Knockouts: Active</li>
    <li>Deck: Custom - 15x male or female Superstars</li>
  </ul>

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Note: Alignment arrows determine the matchup a Superstar creates when choosing the matchup while you have a Superstar in the ring. Left is Power, Right is Toughness, Up is Speed, and Down is Charisma.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Each round, the player in control of the ring will sacrifice 1 of 4 Superstars from their hand to choose the stat for the next match. Their opponent chooses 1 of 4 Superstars to fight in the match, and the loser is knocked out of the ring. The final match (last card) gives 3 points, which can easily turn a loss around.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  The usual pattern is: Play a powerful card and take control of the ring. Then create matches with stats it is strong in until it gets knocked out. Then start over with another powerful card, and repeat.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  The best overall build is 4 (3 of one, because 15-card deck) balanced Superstars with good Techniques in each Alignment. It is hard to keep control of the ring at all times so it will not get a high score, but it will not lose easily either as each card can play up to 4 matches.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  The most useful build is a deck with 1 balanced card of each Alignment and 2 to 3 (as it is a 15-card deck) lowest-tier bases of each alignment. This build is great to get matches played on Superstars quickly. It is also more likely to either lose because it fails to get a powerful Superstar to play soon enough, or get the maximum possible score.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Try to remember to check the grayed-out card on top of the deck that will be drawn next. The minor amount of planning ahead this allows is what makes a perfect game possible.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  This mode can be idled but is very likely to lose as the AI just throws the left-most card. Using the existing and next card draw it is possible to plan ahead and tap where the card you want to use next round will be.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Yes, the abbreviation RR sounds like seal noises, and it is okay to say it like that.

  <br/>

  <div class="line"></div>

  <h3>Elimination Chamber</h3>

  <br/>

  <ul>
    <li>Opponent: AI</li>
    <li>Enemy: Mirror</li>
    <li>Matches: 6+</li>
    <li>Deck: Custom - 10x male or female Superstars</li>
  </ul>

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Each player is dealt six cards from their deck to use in the game. Whichever card loses in each match is removed from the current game.
  
  
  <br/>
  <br/>
  
  Because of how the mode is played, a balanced deck is best as it makes it very hard to lose, and it can even win while idling.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  This mode is faster to play at full speed than Royal Rumble, but gives slightly less SuperCoins and PvP League points.

  <br/>

  <div class="line"></div>

  <h3>Money In The Bank</h3>

  <br/>

  <ul>
  <li>Max Energy: 5</li>
  <li>Energy Regen: 1hr</li>
  <li>FQ Energy Saver/Loss Prevention</li>
  <li>Matches: 5-6</li>
  <li>Enemy: Mirror</li>
  <li>Deck: Custom - 15x male or female Superstar, 1x Manager and 2x Action Support</li>
  </ul>

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Players are given 6 random Superstars and the 2 Action Supports from their deck to use. Managers are activated at the start of the game. The enemy cards are placed in a pyramid shape on the board (in rows of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 top to bottom), ascending in power so their strongest Superstars are at the top. The bottom row is face-up, and those above it are face-down and revealed as the player progresses.
  
  
  <br/>
  <br/>
  
  On the left and right of each row are groups of 1-2 stats (POW, TGH, SPD, CHA), one group of which will be randomly chosen as the matchup for that row. The numbers (+N) on enemies is how many points they are worth, and stronger enemies are always worth the most.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Pick a Superstar to fight in the next match and an enemy for them to fight, and the game will randomly pick one of the stat groups (left or right) for the match. Winning will defeat that row and add the points from that enemy to the Bank. After a loss the opponent will be damaged on the stats for that match and players have to choose a Superstar to fight them again. There are only enough cards to lose one match though.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  If a player defeats every enemy they win and will be rewarded with 2x SuperCoins per point in the Bank. Max points before doubling are 25 (at 5 points per enemy), so max rewards are 50x SC. If a player loses they are rewarded with 1x SC for each point in the Bank.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  The best build is a deck of balanced cards, because it greatly reduces the chance to lose a match or the game. One weak card at most is recommended, because of the single-loss clause to be able to get double rewards.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Try to avoid opponents with Assist, Defend, or Inspire; Chain or Overrun opponents are much safer. Action Support are safest to use in the final 2 matches, but try to pay attention to enemy stats in case they're needed earlier.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  This mode can be idled with a well-balanced deck, but the game just picks the leftmost card each round for each side.

  <h3>King of the Ring</h3>

  <br/>

  <ul>
    <li>Opponent: Mixed, up to 5 per game</li>
    <li>Enemy: Mirror deck tier</li>
    <li>Rounds: 2+</li>
    <li>Matches: 5 per round</li>
    <li>Deck: Custom - 2x male and 1x female Tag Teams, 3x male and 1x female Solo, 1x Manager and 2x Action Support</li>
    <li>Max Reward: Deck tier</li>
  </ul>

  <br/>

  Warning: Cards in an active King of the Ring are locked and cannot be combined or have Equipment changed.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Passively play in a single-elimination tournament against up to 5 opponents (out of 32 players total). (Matchmaking starts on the hour?). Each round Superstars will lose some Energy (based on their Stamina stat). Of course there are special Energy cards to replenish it, but players can only hold up to 25 of them at a time, and there are 10 Superstars in the deck.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Energy cards can be pulled off of the regular Draft Board, and it is possible to watch ads to get Energy cards. There is also a Credit-bought game-automated assistant that will fill the Energy of your Superstars.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  The basic idea for a useful deck is balanced, except for a low-tier base in a Solo matchup or 2 low-tier base in a tag. This build has a better chance to make it past the first round, which rewards 25 Draft Picks instead of 5. It can occasionally go further, and can even win with minimal energy investment (6 total = 1 per tag team + 1 per single, leaving the low card and half of each tag team at 0 energy).

  <br/>
  <br/>

  The deck tier is a large range in this mode, and it seems best to stick to either the beginning or end of the bar.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  <div class="line"></div>

  <h3>Tag Team Takedown</h3>

  <br/>

  <ul>
    <li>15min cooldown after claiming rewards</li>
    <li>Partner: Human (questionable)</li>
    <li>Opponent: AI (mixed?)</li>
    <li>Opponent Decks: Mirrors</li>
    <li>Rounds: 1 per game</li>
    <li>Matches: Up to 9 per game</li>
    <li>Deck: Locked, top 4 male or female Superstars of each Alignment</li>
    <li>Max Reward: Top 8 tier - 1</li>
  </ul>

  <br/>
  <br/>

  In this mode players are paired up either by using the invite system to team up with someone they know in the game, or randomly. At the start of each round one players deck is chosen for each side, and each player on that team is dealt 6 cards from it to use that game.
  
  <br/>
  <br/>
  
  Next the matchup stat is chosen, and both players from each team choose a card to use in the match. Players choose one at a time so that they can see their partners choice before they choose a card when going second. Damage dealt to cards does not knock them out though. The first team to 5 points wins the round.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  After a game is finished each player has the option to Continue or Claim the rewards, and neither player can continue playing without the other. If both players choose to keep going then the opposite deck will be used for the next game. The deck continues to be swapped like this with each game.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  While this is effectively a 2-player vs AI mode, the teammate can easily turn it into a nightmare. Requires attention to go undefeated for max points, and idling will likely lose because the game just picks the leftmost card repeatedly.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  If your partner does not seem to have a tag for a specific Alignment, then do not use it when you pick first unless absolutely necessary. In the unlikelihood they do not even have a neutral tag partner, try not to throw more of the Alignment that caused that discovery when you pick first.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  If you have a card that is damaged on at least 1 stat which is NOT part of the current matchup AND it was a good tag team previously, use it! Your teammate should realize to tag with it using their card that is damaged, which means you will both keep more cards healthy further into the match.

  At the start of the game, players each place a Table (2x1 blocks), Ladder (3x1 blocks), and Chair (1 block) on a 4x4 grid. Then each players deck is split into 6 defending cards and 10 attacking cards, and players are dealt a hand of 6 starting cards. Players then take turns picking a block, and if the block is part of one of the objects, play a match and if they win it reveals that block.
  
  <br/>
  <br/>
  
  Once an entire object is revealed it is destroyed and gives a pack as a reward. If a player destroys all of their opponents objects first they win, if both do it in the same round it is a tie, and if a player runs out of cards they lose. During a players turn they can forfeit, but the rewards are even worse than a loss.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  The animations for the matchups in TLC give a clue what the object found is. It is not very useful as it will not affect the outcome, but it's really cool that the designers and developers included this level of detail.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Try to finish a game before starting another, because when the other person stops playing for the day and it takes 24h or more it results in a lot of wasted potential rewards.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  The randomizer that will place the objects for you uses some terrible patterns. Better to experiment and discover ways to place your objects by playing. Any layout can have success sometimes vs opponents who are not trying very hard, but only a truly good layout will be difficult for the majority of opponents.

  <h3>Survivor Series</h3>

  <br/>

  <ul>
    <li>Opponents: Mixed</li>
    <li>Rounds: 8+</li>
    <li>Matches: 3 per round</li>
    <li>Max Reward: Top 8 tier</li>
  </ul>

  <br/>
  <br/>

  At the start of a game each player is dealt the same pairs of 8 bases from a single tier. Of those, 5 are put in the players hand and 11 into a pool of cards that could be called the bench/locker room/deck. At the start of a round players choose a card in their hand to give to their opponent. Next the game chooses a matchup, and each player chooses their Superstar(s) to fight in the ring. After 3 matches, if there is a tie in points, the game will randomly choose a winner. If a player loses 3 rounds they are eliminated.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  After each round players can Combine a pair of bases in hand, Swap a card in hand for a random one in their deck, or Fortify a pro card with a base in hand by using Combine. Pro cards can be swapped to the deck, or given to other players. The game will not automatically do anything between rounds, but will give a random card to the opponent which can be a pro if one exists.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  It is better to pro or fortify between rounds than it is to swap a useless base hoping for something better, because the useless base can still be traded to an opponent. Between rounds if you have no pairs to pro AND you can fortify a pro AND you can not guarantee getting a pair to pro or tag partner by swapping because there are too many cards or you may not get a bye next round, then fortify the pro.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Drafting 2 opposing tag teams (up/down and left/right) is more reasonable than 2 friendly tag teams (left/right and left/right) because of there being so many players looking for and trading away cards of each Alignment. This also helps keep the 5th Superstar useable if necessary, even though it is always just a base.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Tag teams that share a single stat among their Abilities have a better chance than a 2- or 4-stat tag team. This is because with only 2 high stats a team will lose on the other 2 stats more easily. A 4-stat tag team spreads the stats too thin and are then more likely to lose in all matchups. With 3 stats among them a tag team will have a hard time in matches based on the missing stat, but an easy time in matches based on the shared stat, and still a chance in matches based on the other two stats.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Because legendary superstars have higher stats overall than the lesser-known ones they can sometimes get away with 4-stat tag teams, and will have a slightly better chance in all tag matchups no matter their partner. These are also the cards that are often hardest to pro though, as other players also want to hold onto them. If you don't have a tag partner it is better to swap them with another card in the deck than it is to give them to an opponent.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  If you are in the top 3 and have not had a bye yet AND both other players have, then you are next if neither is knocked out this round. Outside of top 3 the players with the best win-loss records have a high chance of getting a bye, but will not always.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  The Supermove is great for making top 4, but it is best when saved to make top 2 or win. When using it, it is best to Win round 1 and then throw a should-win for round 2 and back it up with the Super. It is important to remember though that the opponent can also use a Super, and at that point it is back to a fair match again.

  Each mode consists of 1 or more rounds which are 3 or more matches each. In some modes, at the beginning of each round players are dealt a new hand of cards, and Support Action cards may be refreshed. A match can be Solo or Tag with male or female Superstars. The winner of each round is determined by the greater total of up to 3 stats.

  <h3>Ring Domination</h3>

  <br/>

  <ul>
  <li>Max Energy: 5</li>
  <li>Energy Regen: 15min</li>
  <li>FQ Energy Saver/Loss Prevention</li>
  <li>Matches: 0-8</li>
  <li>Opponent: AI</li>

  <li>Deck(s): Custom</li>
  <li>Max Reward: Deck tier & Grind-based</li>
  <li>Top-tier event card base</li>
  <li>Heroic Mode</li>
  </ul>

  <br/>
  <br/>

  This mode is played in a 3x3 square grid. Each player is assigned a color - human is blue and the AI is red - and when a Superstar first enters the ring it will be highlighted with the color of its team. The Alignment arrow is then considered - if it's pointing at another Superstar AND they are on the enemy team, then they will fight in a random stat matchup. The loser of the match is then converted to the winners team by changing their color.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  A balanced deck that is half-filled with two opposing Alignments (e.g. up/left or down/right) does well as it can force opponents into a corner and beat them down. A deck that has at least one of each alignment will have a better chance to go undefeated. It is possible to use a single weak card to lower the average power of the deck for easier opponents, and when drawn throw that into a corner you can attack into.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  The AI seems to prefer to fill holes to keep the board square/rectangular, but will not always do so if there is a card it can hit or will be forced to hit and lose to. The AI will sometimes avoid an obvious loss, and other times will play into it.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Not a great idea to idle this mode, as the AI does not actually try to play for you and instead just throws a card into the ring and sometimes gets lucky and triggers a match.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  The Event Card reward is a special card that is slightly more powerful than a regular card. Event Cards also have the special "Any" Style.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  After getting the Heroic upgrade for the event card it is added to the list of picked cards again, so if it is not locked this is a second chance to accidentally dust it.

  <br/>

  It is possible to drop your deck tier to get to a lower reward tier.

    <li>Heroic Mode</li>
  </ul>

  <br/>
  <br/>

  At the beginning of each round both players are dealt 4 cards from their deck.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  A balanced deck will have the best chance, because the enemies will scale in power to eventually become maximum power for the top tier, which is called a wall. After reaching a wall it is possible to update your deck with stronger cards (to increase the deck tier) and get weaker opponents for longer.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  As with any mode that has scaling enemies, this is great for getting matches played on Superstars. If losing the guarantee of perfect games is okay it is possible to scale your deck by replacing 1-2 weak cards with stronger cards as the enemies begin to grow. If you play carefully this will be enough to prevent losing and continue getting matches played on Superstars that will become pros. Only recommended if the event card/Heroic mode are not an option and you have anything useful to pro.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  This can be idled, but it is best in the early stages where wins are guaranteed. The later stages require increasing attention depending on the balance of the deck (both stats and Alignments).

  <br/>
  <br/>

  After getting the Heroic upgrade for an event card it is added to the list of picked cards again, and if not locked this is a second chance to accidentally dust it.

  </ul>

  <br/>
  <br/>

  An unbalanced deck should be okay as this is an MMO-style raid boss event, but using the highest power deck possible will help farm the rewards a little faster.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Using 2-4 cards each round is best even if they do not match the Giant because it gives a better chance of getting 3 or 4 of a kind. Round 1 throw any matching arrow and if less than 3 cards add either the most- or least-common other Alignment; e.g. with a Giant using R and a hand of R L U U D throw the R and either U U - or - L and/or D. While cutting into 4 of a kind for at least 1 Alignment hurts it gives a better chance to get a 3 of a kind match and a little extra damage overall when you whiff anyways.

  Ugh. The only mode Styles (Grappler, Striker, Brawler, High-Flyer, Orator, event cards are All) are used, but it is still not worth focusing on them at all. Balanced deck with 4x each Alignment is best as they will still have some of the Styles when needed but will also have a better chance of matching Alignment rings which are roughly equally common to Style rings despite being outnumbered at 4:5.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  The AI seems to vary slightly from slow and stupid to fast and smart, so if it is not taking a move you can delay your turn until the last moments to help screw them over. If it is making moves try to avoid butting heads unless you have matches for that ring - it is a computer, you can not do math as fast, and they love screwing us over.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  If there are any debuff Action Support in your deck they can be used to Knockout an opponent by getting it to 0 points in any stat as long as you have not used a support in that slot yet.

  <br/>

  A balanced deck is best as with all mirror opponents. It is possible to play with the power of the weakest card in the deck using Momentum/Equipment (and Levels, if it is under max) to try to fix losing matchups, but doing so will obviously slow down the grind.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Block and Reveal should not be used immediately as the early Arenas have such a low point potential; better to save them until there is at least 4 Obstacles to Reveal 3x and Block 1x, and then streak through the Arena for max points.

  I follow the arrows of opponents until they reveal they're not pointing to the boss, e.g. 1 points left at another that points right, or up to down, or etc. After that I assume the whole board is pointing away from the boss, and then take something like the reverse path of where the cards point.

  </ul>

  <br/>

  A balanced deck is best, because yet again the enemies are Mirror. An assistant can help remember what you have tried previously across multiple attempts: <a href="https://l3laze.github.io/toys/cb_assist">Code Breaker Assistant</a> (based on <a href="https://github.com/nebupookins/JS-Mastermind-Solver/">JS-Mastermind-Solver by nebupookins</a>). Could be done with pen/cil and paper, this is just easier because I am a lazy nerd.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Strangest mode in the game, similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)">Mastermind</a> board game. Cards are dragged from a face-up deck for each alignment arrow into one of four slots in each round in an attempt to guess what the code is for that level. To the right of the 4 slots for each round are a small scoreboard; the top is the number of arrows that are a part of the code and are in the right slot (correct, checkmark on the scoreboard), and the bottom is the number of arrows that are a part of the code but are in the wrong spot (misplaced, circle shape on scoreboard). Arrows that are not a part of the code are 0 points for each of correct and misplaced scores.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  After guessing a code our cards fight the opposing cards, and for each match fought we get points with more for a win. Enemy stats can be "inflated" for rounds 1-3, and are insane in round 4. If you solve the code before the final round it will skip to the final round and give bonus points for each round skipped. Finishing a level by solving the code also gives points.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  In the final round any cards in the correct spot will severely weaken the opponents who otherwise get a massive stat boost, and it makes winning the match much easier. Any part that's correct in the final round is also noted by the game itself, so rather than a ? in that slot of the code displayed above the playing area it will be the known-correct arrow. We can still use the wrong arrow in that slot though, but that's not a good idea unless you can somehow afford to use 2 or more energy per 1 level.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  <b>Manual play cycle</b>

  <ul>
    <li>Round 1: Throw 4x of one alignment, any points correct or misplaced mean there are that many of that alignment in the final code.</li>
    <li>Round 2: Throw only the number of arrows equal to points in round 1, and fill the rest with a second alignment. Because any that were correct in round 1 can be out of place this often leads to 1+ correct and 1+ in the wrong place, but these are clues for the final code.</li>
    <li>Round 3: Throw the known-good arrows from round 1 and 2 out again, attempting to guess where they are correct based on the clues so far. Again, fill the rest with another arrow, and note any clues given.</li>
    <li>Round 4: Take a crack at solving.</li>
  </ul>

  <br/>
  <br/>

Refresher items that "heal" Superstars are uncommon-rare except those that are guaranteed from free packs. They are best saved for the final round as the Superstar will otherwise be damaged and render the Refresher wasted. It would also be a waste to start using them immediately as the point totals are so low.

<br/>
<br/>

Use Refreshers only in the final round while the code is solved AND a Superstar is too weak to beat the weakened enemy in the final round or has at least 1 weak stat and the enemy has Reversal. Only rely on Techniques to give buffs and prevent loss if you don't have Refreshers or are buying energy anyways and don't have to care.

<br/>
<br/>

Doublers are similarly not good to use too early because the point totals are so low. Better to wait until reaching at least level 10 before starting to use them, unless you are going to whale and don't care about the slight waste. Whale or not, if you're going hardcore it would not be unreasonable to wait longer before starting to use Doublers. This will require some effort (math, preferably) to determine how many levels you expect to beat and how many Doublers you are willing to buy. Then figure out where the N Doublers can fit in as far into the levels as possible (without risking them getting wasted from the event ending) for maximum points.

It's effectively Giants Unleashed: Personal Edition. Important differences are the personal-sized enemies, use of event-based Collectibles like snowballs or movie reels (which can be bought with Credits or picked off the Draft Board) to fight instead of Energy, and it gives rewards immediately after fighting an opponent rather than after the event ends. In the most recent iteration (RTWM in March 2023), 1-3 Collectibles could be used on top of the cost of fighting an enemy to give a 25/50/75% stat boost to our entire deck. Slightly larger boom.

<br/>
<br/>

The cost to fight enemies and size of them scales with progression, and there are larger mini-bosses periodically which give better rewards than the smalls between them. Rewards also scale and the best stuff is at the final boss, but the odds of getting those best rewards still aren't great. Because of this the most efficient way to farm rewards, if you choose to try to do so, would be to reach the highest mini-boss you believe you can.

<br/>
<br/>

Your expected reach will have to be estimated based on the cost to fight the first mini-boss and the little ones along the way, along with how hard you're going to be grinding to farm Collectibles. If you're struggling to find free Collectibles from the Draft Board to be able to fight then it's probably not worth trying to farm rewards.

<br/>
<br/>

If the "Little Giants" of IYH are too strong to fight it is more efficient to either buy the most expensive reward in the Collectibles Store (Main menu -> Store -> Collectibles) if you have enough AND the potential cards can help you grow and you're feeling lucky, or buy the 5-25x Draft Picks instead if the cards are too weak to be helpful anyways.

<br/>
<br/>

The Collectibles Store is open for a few days after Collectibles can be picked off the Draft Board, so there's time to dump them for picks/packs/etc after if you are busy elsewhere and skip this event. Card backs from Collectibles store are usually pretty nice, and don't cost very much (25 Collectibles in RTWM).

  <br/>
  <br/>

  A balanced deck that is half-filled with 2x opposing Alignments (e.g. up/left or down/right) does well as it can force opponents into a corner and beat them down. A deck that has at least 1x each alignment will have a better chance to go undefeated for +1 draft pick.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  The AI seems to prefer to fill holes to keep the board square/rectangular, but can not always do so.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Shards are pieces of the card, and are acquired by resetting the draft board after playing a game of TRD.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  The TRD draft board is shared with the regular draft board, but with separate Draft Picks. Because of this it is possible to pick at the regular board until there is not much left and then play some TRD for an easy shard, rinse and repeat.

  Random decks usually suck, so this is best for teams that cannot build a good deck for TSG. Often run either during events, like Team or Solo RD/RTG when players will grind anyways and it will not be hard to get charges, or between them so players have time to concentrate on the events instead.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  For max points use FQ to prevent losses. The weakest teammates should attack weakest opponents, and strongest vs strongest. With no activity log it is hard to tell when some1 with a strong deck is beating on weak opponents and screwing the team, but the point totals can give it away.

  I have not played enough to develop a full strategy yet as my team has not run many, but it is obviously better than TBG. With an easily modifiable deck that can be guaranteed powerful it will be much more reasonable for a strong team. Try to build a balanced deck full of potential tag teams; neutral and incompatible teams will inevitably cause losses.

 <br/>
 <br/>

  Try to fill 1 bar/star at a time rather than hitting all of them, unless your team is going to be active enough to fill at least 2 of them so that the third will not be a waste.

  <h3>Deck-Reward Relation</h3>

  <br/>

  Rewards in the game are often based on the tier of a specific deck. For example, the deck Top 8 is often used to determine reward eligibility, including some packs in the Store that can be bought with Credits (which can be paid for with $). Not all of the packs are like this of course, so if you are spending Credits make sure you know what you are buying.

  <br/>

  This system makes explosive growth seem like a good idea of course - grow faster and get better rewards sooner. And in the beginning explosive growth works great, but then you will start to get cards that are from a higher tier than the rest of a deck and greatly increase the maximum and average power of any deck they are in.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  When the average power of a deck increases too far past the minimum power (the weakest card) it becomes unbalanced and it is far more likely to lose matchups and games. Yes; Minimum, Average, Maximum - basic math class came back for you, as you may have feared. A safer way to upgrade is to make sure you do not let any decks you will need to use become unbalanced for too long, which is a relative amount of time based on what events are active and upcoming along with how active you are.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Many game modes do not use the Top 8 for their rewards though, but instead larger decks. This is where it gets hardest to not let it get unbalanced, but also where it has the most room for slightly-higher stats at the top end because of the higher number of cards in the deck lowering the average.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  The simplest way to protect from getting screwed by an overpowered card is to under-level cards so that their stats will be near the rest of the deck after they have their matches played. The easiest way to do this is by closely managing the cards you are using as feeders. For example, use the highest rarity feeders to train cards that will not be more powerful than the average of whatever deck you are messing with, and then use lower rarity cards as feeders to more slowly level up a stronger card to fit into the deck.

  <h3>Deck Management</h3>

  <br/>

  While a locked deck cannot be directly changed it is still possible to change the cards in it by selectively increasing card stats on those you would rather be using. Equipment is the best way as it is the smallest effect so it does not increase the average power of the deck as much. Momentum is a lot harder to use on any base or pro of the deck tier for this effect, but can still work well on a pro at deck tier - 1.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  In modes where it is possible to FQ to prevent loss and retry without losing progress tweaking the power of the bottom card can be used to overcome an undefeatable matchup as it will modify the enemy stats. LMS is all I know of where this works, but maybe CoC too.

  If you are a new or returning (after how long IDK) many modes will give a starter pack of weak cards, which are always weak no matter your tier. Worth collecting a bunch ASAP to grow your top tier before you start doing anything else.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Lock 10/15 male or female Superstars for use in decks. If you have 10/15x of a single rarity, great - they can be used without even leveling them up. If you have to level anything up that is near to your decks tier, Train with 1 card at a time until you know how many it takes to level cards of that tier up to a balanced state with the rest of the deck.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Level your best 2-stat Manager Support, and optionally the best 2x Action Support. If you have 4x male + 2x female that will not screw up the 10/15 cards saved for your PvP deck, it is worth it to level those up to increase your top 8 tier.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Push for 20k points in PvP for the extra reward pack if possible, or as many Momentum slots as you can get if not. Top 5 in a PvP group get a promotion up to Silver, then Gold, then Platinum League, and extra SuperCoins. Top 50 Global get Credits, which can be done for free by burning ads for energy if people are very busy in events (which is extremely hard to judge). When you get Momentum put it on as many cards in your top 8 as you can without messing up any decks, and update it as your top 8 changes.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Many events will not seem very rewarding, but do what you can to at least get minimal rewards - Giants Unleashed is great to return into as you can participate without being strong. MitB is not very profitable at lower point totals even when you win and get 2x SC rewards, but it is still a good addition to SC if you have the time to play it.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Use draft picks as you see fit and hold feeders to help build your top 8 tier as you get bigger cards. Do not get too attached as all cards will turn into feeders sooner or later. Imperfect Pros are fine at this point, but they are better if you level them to 100 and skip playing matches as leveling gives far more stats.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Once your rate of growth slows, start building balanced decks of your powerful cards. Make sure to build proper/perfect Pro Superstar (using RR and Performance Center for matches played) and Support cards for maximum rarity tier, because no matter how balanced a deck of imperfect Pro cards will fall short of ++ in its own rarity tier.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also, try to play Survivor/TLC regularly for rewards, especially when you're trying to build out a deck. Great for Exclusive Draft Picks, and once you learn to play well, high-tier cards.

  <h3>Draft Picks</h3>

  There is no right or wrong way to pull draft picks from any board (regular, T/RD, Exclusive). If you develop some way that works for you, run with it - every method I have tried seems to have roughly equal chances of pulling a reset from the board.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  If you are pulling picks looking for something in particular and you are not finding it, stop and do something else. Whether that means playing a different mode for a few minutes or not playing at all. Save the picks, come back later and try again - your RNG can change over time. If you are pulling picks and getting fast resets or anything else useful though, obviously it may be worth it to continue even if it is not exactly what you wanted.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  As with many digital games with random rewards, this game has implemented a pity mechanism. After you have pulled enough Draft Board resets and not gotten a card of your current Top 8 tier, it will be guaranteed from your next Draft Board reset.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  There is also a guaranteed tier card after reaching a new tier you have not been at before. At each of tier+ or tier++ the pity timer is slightly decreased.

  <br/>

  <div class="line"></div>

  <h3>Dust, Dusting, Dusty Rhodes?</h3>

  When dusting cards it is best to look through 1 page at a time and ensure that nothing you want to keep is selected, for example top-tier cards and event cards. The game may expand their recent addition of new cards and cards that are new pros not being selected during this process, but that is only a rumor currently.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Dusting Dusty may be a dust crime.

  <br/>

  <div class="line"></div>

  <h3>Cards</h3>

  Keep the Superstar and Support cards that are in use or useable once they are pro locked, and lock new stuff that is worth keeping. Customer Support will only return 1 card 1 time; after that there is no help for a mistake. Naturally, also go through the locked cards occasionally and clean out what is become garbage or anything that was accidentally locked.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  When Training, it helps to filter by tier so it is easier to use the Select All option on a bunch of junk at once, and then look through quick to ensure nothing that should be saved is used.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Enhancement cards are only useful for Training, so if you are careful enough while Training cards then they are not worth locking.
  
  <br/>
  <br/>

  Holiday Fusion Ingredients are special cards. They are not locked by default, and will not get selected while dusting, nor while Training (even after the event finishes -- <em>hunt them down, Guardian</em>).

  <br/>

  <div class="line"></div>

  <h3>Currencies</h3>

  SuperCoins are easily gained, but can be burned much faster. Their best use is the top-tier PLE (Paid Live Event) cards early to around midway into a tier and the 25x Draft Picks at any time, though there can be some luck with the 1-4k SC packs and there are some nice limited-edition pics on the Special Edition (SE) cards.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Draft Picks are a preferable buy because of the potential to get Point Doublers/Collectibles/dust/TBG Charges/KotR Energy, and the draft board resets that lead to tier pulls.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  Credits are rare enough they should be saved for getting guaranteed rewards unless you are paying for them and do not have to care.

  <br/>

  <div class="line"></div>

  <h3>Rewards</h3>

  Rewards that come through the in-game Mail with an expiration on them can be saved, and some can upgrade to contain cards from a tier that was unreleased when they were given (?). Exclusive Draft Pick rewards are especially worth stockpiling to prepare for this.

  <br/>

  <div class="line"></div>

  <h3>Point/Pick Doublers</h3>

  A special card that doubles the points and/or draft picks from a game of T/RD or T/RTG. They can be found on the regular draft board or bought with Credits.

  <br />
  <br />

  If you have 1+ it will be activated automatically and cannot be deactivated. If you have 0 Doublers and find 1 on the draft board it will not be activated automatically because of an old bug. Returning to the start page of the game (not the main menu) and coming back in to the game, or just playing a game in any mode normally, will cause it to activate.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  <div class="line"></div>

  <h3>Supermove</h3>

  Nuke vs Nuke as a strategy. Charge it up by playing matches, and when activated it will double the stats of your cards in the current match. Best used to overcome unbeatable opponents in events or guarantee a win in Survivor for better rewards.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  This does not work the same in all modes, e.g. Royal Rumble in particular where it will instead auto-defeat the enemy and set the stat that would have been used to 0 on the surviving Superstar.

  <br/>
  <br/>

  In live multiplayer, other players also have a Supermove.
