TLC

Pay attention to search and placement patterns used in games to help discover some patterns that you are comfortable and uncomfortable with. Can take notes, screenshots, whatever is necessary to help remember.

It may help to think of the ring as a numbered grid, like


    1,  2,  3,  4
    5,  6,  7,  8
     9, 10, 11, 12
    13, 14, 15, 16


Each piece cleared without finding the Table or Ladder further limits the possible placements of them. It's especially good to pay attention to the limitations of the Ladder as it can greatly limit where the others have room and make them easier to find.

Often a multi-block object can be found on a center edge (rope) at the beginning of a game, leaving the next piece a 33% chance to be in each of 3 directions. Often, it is instead a 50% chance to be along the rope away from the corner OR away from the rope towards the center of the ring.

When searching, a jagged diagonal line is effective as it creates limits very fast. On the grid above, for example, imagine the line 2 - 6 - 7 - 12. This would leave 5 possible placements of the Ladder (1 - 5 - 9, 5 - 9 - 13, 9 - 10 - 11, 13 - 14 - 15, 14 - 15 - 16). Picking 9 next leaves only 2 or 3 possible places for the Ladder.

Searching like a knight in chess can also be effective (1 block vertically or horizontally, then 2 blocks the opposite - horizontally if first was vertically or vertically if first was horizontally), but

New player/trying to climb

* Visit all available modes for free junk cards. Garbage, but better than nothing!

* Farm PvP to get points for more Momentum slots for the next week of PvP leagues. Superstars can be placed in Momentum slots to give them a small stat boost; not much effect on top 8 but it is helpful.

* When you have time, farm Money in the Bank using a deck of balanced cards. Low SuperCoin rewards early on suck, but later it becomes 5/match for 25/game. If you win the game the reward is multiplied by 2. Spend SC on 25x draft picks if you feel like you can grow faster early on that way rather than saving for a big card, but be careful as you will want to save up for a big card eventually.

* TLC may be hard/impossible, but if you can win games it's a good farm. Survivor is a draft mode, so it's more fair as everyone starts with the same cards (but not the same cards in hand), and top 4 or better gives the best rewards. Just don't burn all Survivor tickets too fast as they give guaranteed rewards so are best when you're playing for higher-tier cards.

* Farm rotating events (those with a time limit) for any possible rewards, and for draft picks. Giants Unleashed is great as we're rewarded afterwards just for hitting as many of the bosses as possible for any amount of damage over 0. Most other events require a lot more work to get rewards, unfortunately.

* Claim free packs every 4h, and if possible watch the ad for the extra pack too.

* Watch up to 20 (25?) ads per day for energy in modes that use it. Best used for PvP or MitB at first to get Momentum and SuperCoins to help you out later.
